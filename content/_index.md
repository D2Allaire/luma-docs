## Lightweight
No styles or components you will never use, no unnecessary weight. Luma's size is merely __6kb gzipped__. No additional dependencies. There is no unwanted bloat that comes with the larger frameworks. By default, Luma only ships with the most used components.
## Opinionated
Tired of ugly looking forms? Luma comes with a set of beautifully styled components so that your project looks good _from the very beginning_.
    {{% /column %}}
    {{< column class="is-4" >}}
      {{< image src="/images/leafs.png" >}}
    {{< /column >}}  
  {{< /row >}}
{{< /section >}}
{{< section class="blue" >}}
  {{< row >}}
    {{% column class="is-8" %}}
## Modular
On top of the default framework Luma comes with a bunch of additional components that you can include in your project. Modals, pagination indicators, loading spinner, you name it. Most components you will use in your projects are already there and can be included  by simply commenting out a line.
## Customizable
Luma was written in SCSS and with easy customization in mind. Every component can be freely customized with the provided variables. The most relevant files for customization are `src/utilities/_config.scss` and `src/utilities/_variables.scss`. Here you can easily switch out color values (such as the `$color-primary`) and customize other configuration values.
Read more about it in the [documentation]({{< relref "docs/_installation.md" >}}).
