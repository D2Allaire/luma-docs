- Add default flag to font-stack. This way you can easily overwrite it in your setup.
- **Important**: Use classes for radios and checkboxes. We've found that it's sometimes inconvenient to apply the
custom styling for checkboxes and radios to every single `radio` or `checkbox` element in the DOM. For example,
it would create issues when trying to create a checkbox toggle switch. For this reason, all radios and checkboxes must
declare the `radio` or `checkbox` class to receive custom styling.

Example:  
`<input type="checkbox">` - will _not_ receive luma styling
`<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox">` - will receive luma styling

- Only restrict image height on brand image. Previously, all images in your navigation would have their max-height set
to `($nav-height - 2rem)`.
