- Remove unnecessary styles for links in collections. They now use the default link styling.
- Improve text and especially link colors on alerts. Links in alerts were previously unreadable due to using the default link color.
- The navigation now needs to be manually initialized with the `luma.nav()` method. See the documentation section for the navigation component for more details.

Versions 0.4.4 and 0.4.4 were minor fixes based on these mentioned improvements and not worth further expanding upon.
