- Use the ES6 export (`export default luma`) instead of ES5 (`module.exports = luma`). Let me know if this leads to 
issues in your installation.
- Use blue color for checkboxes by default
- Add text color modifier classes. You can now use `text-primary`, `text-info`, `text-success`, `text-warning` and
`text-danger` on any text elements (e.g. `p` or `span`) to apply the standard colors to your text.
- I have added a utility class to align items vertically: `flex-group`. 

Example:
```html
<div class="flex-group">
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <button class="is-right">Download</button>
</div>
```

This would vertically align the h1 and button. Additionally, the button would be aligned to the right side.

- Use different transition for checkboxes and make file selects the same height as other form elements
- Remove padding on container. If this leads to issues, let me know.
