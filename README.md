> **Luma** is a *lightweight, flexible* CSS framework

#### Lightweight

No styles or components you will never use, no unnecessary weight. Lumaâ€™s size is merely **8kb gzipped**. No additional dependencies. There is no unwanted bloat that comes with the larger frameworks. By default, Luma only ships with the most used components.



#### Installation

With npm:

```bash
$ npm install lumacss
```

With yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add lumacss
```
